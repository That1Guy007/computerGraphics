\tableofcontents

\section intro Introduction

In this example we simply track the mouse position output from a move and a press event.
It also updates the box by centering it on the cursor if the click was a left click. It
also incorporates a click and drag feature that will resize the box.

The console window will display your graphics card OpenGL version support and the
graphics window will display a multicolored box.  The title bar of the window will also
display the number of frames per second for the last second.  When the mouse is moved
the position of the mouse will be displayed on the console screen.  When a mouse button
is pressed or released the position of the mouse will be displayed on the console screen
along with which button was pressed or released and a note on which action was taken.
The position output will be displayed in both pixel position coordinates and in converted
screen coordinates. It also updates the box by centering it on the cursor if the click was
a left click and adjusting the size of the box on a click and drag.  On a click and drag the
box will be adjusted so that the green corner of the box will be on the cursor.

\subsection options User Options

If no modifier keys are pressed:

- Escape:  Ends the program.
- M: Toggles between fill mode and line mode to draw the triangles.
- R: Resets the window size to 700 X 500.
- A: Resets the window size to 600 X 600.
- F10: Saves a screen shot of the graphics window to a png file.
- Left: Moves the box to the left.
- Right: Moves the box to the right.
- Up: Moves the box up.
- Down: Moves the box down.

If the control key is down:

- R: Resets the box size.

If the control or Z key is down:

- Left: Decreases the width of the box.
- Right: Increases the width of the box.
- Up: Decreases the height of the box.
- Down: Increases the height of the box.

\note Note that the shader programs "PassThroughVert.glsl" and "PassThroughFrag.glsl" are expected
to be in the same folder as the executable.  Your graphics card must also be able to support
OpenGL version 3.3 to run this program.
