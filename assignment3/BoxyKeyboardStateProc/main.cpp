/**
\mainpage Keyboard: State Processing

\tableofcontents

\section intro Introduction

In this example we bypass the event firing loop and process the current keyboard state
by polling the desired keys to see if they are pressed or not.

The console window will display your graphics card OpenGL version support and the
graphics window will display a multicolored box.  The title bar of the window will also
display the number of frames per second for the last second.

\subsection options User Options

If no modifier keys are pressed:

- Escape:  Ends the program.
- M: Toggles between fill mode and line mode to draw the triangles.
- R: Resets the window size to 700 X 500.
- A: Resets the window size to 600 X 600.
- F10: Saves a screen shot of the graphics window to a png file.
- Left: Moves the box to the left.
- Right: Moves the box to the right.
- Up: Moves the box up.
- Down: Moves the box down.

If the control key is down:

- Left: Decreases the width of the box.
- Right: Increases the width of the box.
- Up: Decreases the height of the box.
- Down: Increases the height of the box.
- R: Resets the box size.

If the alt key is down:

- Left: Decreases the width and height of the box.
- Right: Increases the width and height of the box.
- R: Resets the window position to (20, 20).

If the shift key is down:

- Left: Sets vertex 0 to a random color.
- Right: Sets vertex 1 to a random color.
- Up: Sets vertex 2 to a random color.
- Down: Sets vertex 3 to a random color.

\note Note that the shader programs "PassThroughVert.glsl" and "PassThroughFrag.glsl" are expected
to be in the same folder as the executable.  Your graphics card must also be able to support
OpenGL version 3.3 to run this program.
