\mainpage Cameras & Basic 3-D Setup

\section intro Introduction

This program is a demo program for the basic setup for 3-D OpenGL rendering.  It
incorporates classes for axes and a simple multi-colored cube.  It also has classes
for a spherical camera and yaw-pitch-roll camera.

The initial screen will render the coordinate axes and a grid of multi-colored cubes.  The
options discussed below can be used to alter the position of the camera and scene objects.
The difference between this example and the previous one is that the projection, view, and
model matrices are loaded to the shader and the matrix multiplication is done at the shader
level.  In the previous exercise the matrix multiplication was done on the CPU and the result
was loaded to the shader.

\subsection options User Options

- Escape:  Ends the program.
- M: Toggles between fill mode and line mode to draw the triangles.
- F1: Sets the flag to draw a single box.
- F2: Sets the flag to draw a grid of boxes.
- F3: Sets the flag to draw boxes.
- F4: Sets the flag to hide boxes.
- F10: Saves a screen shot of the graphics window to a png file.
- F11 or O: Turns on the spherical camera.
- F12 or P: Turns on the yaw-pitch-roll camera.

If the spherical camera is currently selected,

If no modifier keys are pressed:

- Left: Increases the camera's theta value.
- Right: Decreases the camera's theta value.
- Up: Increases the camera's psi value.
- Down: Decreases the camera's psi value.

If the control or Z key is down:

- Up: Decreases the camera's radius.
- Down: Increases the camera's radius.

If the yaw-pitch-roll camera is currently selected,

If no modifier keys are pressed:

- Left: Increases the yaw.
- Right: Decreases the yaw.
- Up: Increases the pitch.
- Down: Decreases the pitch.

If the control or Z key is down:

- Left: Increases the roll.
- Right: Decreases the roll.
- Up: Moves the camera forward.
- Down: Moves the camera backward.

If the shift or S key is down:

- Left: Moves the camera left.
- Right: Moves the camera right.
- Up: Moves the camera up.
- Down: Moves the camera down.

If the spherical camera is currently selected, a click and drag with the left mouse
button will alter the theta and psi angles of the spherical camera to give the impression
of the mouse grabbing and moving the coordinate system.

\note Note that the shader programs "VertexShaderBasic3D.glsl" and "PassThroughFrag.glsl"
are expected to be in the same folder as the executable.  Your graphics card must also be
able to support OpenGL version 3.3 to run this program.
